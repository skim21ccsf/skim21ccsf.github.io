    <p>
        Overcrowded buses, sometimes more than once, will skip your stop if no one on that bus is offboarding. It seems that the bus stops closer to downtown become tough to catch. I avoid attempts to board any bus where passengers are spilling onto the stairs and obstructing my view of the driver in the front.<br><br>The infrequent F attracts tourists or large groups of children on field trips. Try to avoid this bus for commuting to work, or catch it before 9am. <br><br>BART stops running a bit after midnight. I find tha Powell Station feels safer than Civic Center for late evenings.
