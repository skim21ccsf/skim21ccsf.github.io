    <p>Many of my friends live around<a href="http://www.bart.gov/stations/balb" target="_blank" class="a_current">Balboa Park Station</a>, and Powell stops you right inside a massive retail area where I can quickly shop for gifts and hop back onto a train. Powell is conveniently also the intersection of a lot of different public transit routes within the city.<br><br> I like the 1st & Market Muni bus stop. There are a lot of coffee options if you find yourself having to wait 15 minutes or more for your bus. The Ferry Terminal is another nice bus stop to offboard during your free time. Any stop along the Embarcadero is usually a good option.
